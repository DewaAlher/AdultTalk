                You know that becoming parent is hard. I am tottaly agree with that. If you so let me explain what
                exatly you should do when you're have a child:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>You should pay their live
                    <p>I think you should know that if you hhave a child you should feed them, get in then to school,
                        and so on. You need a lot of money to doing that. </p>

                </li>
                <li>You should listening to them
                    <p>If you have a lot of child you can really understand the reason why i say this. Because a lot of
                        child that could have a lot of problem. Do you understand if human is the best of giving problem
                        to another human?</p>
                    <p>Whant kind of problem that i mean?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>World War 1</li>
                        <li>World war 2</li>
                        <li>Any of war that could be happen because of human itself</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Why i'm not putting World War Hulk in that list? because it's copyright. But i'm just putting
                        that world war instead because "war" is caused so much tragedy in everyone life. Ressesion could
                        be happen, ecomonic collapse, bankcrupncy on small country and so on. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
